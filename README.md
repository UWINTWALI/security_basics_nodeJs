# security_basics_nodeJs


## Description:
This repository is meant to provide hands-on experience with backend development using Node.js and Express.js. It aims to guide you through the process of setting up a basic Express.js server and creating API endpoints for user authentication, expense management, and expense calculations. By working on this project, you will gain practical knowledge in server-side scripting, API design, and routing using the powerful combination of Node.js and Express.js.

## Requirements:

### Setting up Express.js Server:
        Initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.js as a dependency.
        Create an index.js file to define the entry point for your Express.js server.
        Configure the Express.js server to listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000).
        Implement basic error handling middleware to handle server errors.

### User Authentication API Endpoint:
        Create an API endpoint (POST /api/auth/login) for user authentication.
        Implement user login functionality using mock user data (e.g., username, password).
        Validate user credentials.
        Secure the authentication endpoint using appropriate security measures (e.g., password hashing).

### Expense Management API Endpoints:
        Implement API endpoints for managing expenses:
            GET /api/expenses: Retrieve all expenses for a user.
            POST /api/expenses: Add a new expense for a user.
            PUT /api/expenses/:id: Update an existing expense.
            DELETE /api/expenses/:id: Delete an existing expense.

### Expense Calculation API Endpoint:
        Create an API endpoint (GET /api/expense) to calculate the total expense for a user.
        Calculate the total expenses for the user based on the expense records.
        Return the total expense amount as a JSON response.

### Security Considerations:
        Implement security best practices for user authentication (e.g., password hashing, JWT).
        Validate user input and sanitize data to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
        Secure sensitive data and API endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
